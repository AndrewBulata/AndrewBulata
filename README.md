### Hi there 👋

I'm Andrew, former chemistry student & basketball player 🏀. I studied chemistry at Imperial College London, where I specialised in organic synthesis and drug discovery for cancer chemotherapy. Following graduation, I ventured into the finance sector, initially as a Mergers & Acquisitions analyst in Central Europe and later transitioning into a data analyst role in London.

- 🔭 I’m learning Data Science & Natural Language Processing at the moment.
- 🌱 I’m interested in the interplay between language, science, and AI.
- 👨‍🎓 I'm fluent in 4 languages and currently studing 2 more.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with NLP.
- 💬 Ask me about anything.

I am eager to collaborate on computational projects, ranging from data science and NLP to Arduino programming. Let's connect!
