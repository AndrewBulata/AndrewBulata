### Hi there 👋

I'm Andrew, former student & basketball player 🏀. I studied chemistry at Imperial College London, where I specialised in organic synthesis and drug discovery for cancer chemotherapy. Following graduation, I ventured into the finance sector, initially as a Mergers & Acquisitions analyst in Central Europe and later transitioning into a data analyst role in London.

- 🔭 I’m learning Data Science & Natural Language Processing at the moment.
